To convert the Zone10_20[09-14]_01.*.zip files to CSV format, we used Anaconda
to install the GDAL library:

    conda install gdal

This provides the ogr2ogr command, which we used to convert each *.gdb
extracted directory into a set of CSV files. 

For instance,

    ogr2ogr -f CSV output.csv Zone10_2009_01.gdb -lco GEOMETRY=AS_XYZ

produces the following files:

    Vessel.csv
    Voyage.csv
    output.csv

In all years except 2010, the output.csv should be renamed to Broadcast.csv.
For 2010, output.csv should be renamed to Voyage.csv. (Broadcast.csv is 
generated directly from the ogr2ogr program.)

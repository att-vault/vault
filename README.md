# AT&T Vault Tech Scenario

This repository contains the draft code used to explore and analyze the data in the 12/2020 "Technical Scenario" document for VAULT. It is organized into a set of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org). Ideally, notebooks with interactive plots should be viewed "live", with a running Python server, so that the data can be fully explored interactively. PDF copies of most notebooks are provided for quick skimming or in case the notebook code or data is not available for running. 

## Notebooks

The notebooks fall into the following categories:

### EDA

These notebooks start with raw data where possible, with a goal of revealing it as it is, with as little cleanup as possible, so that same process can be applied to new data. These are primarily self contained, not relying on external scripts or modules in this repository (just packages in the Python environment installed).

- Viewing_AIS.ipynb: Basic rendering of location data from sets of AIS pings.
- Viewing_AIS_Categorical.ipynb: Breakdown of AIS location data by vessel type.
- Viewing_TLEs.ipynb: Basic rendering of earth-centered satellite location at epoch time from sets of TLEs.

### Data exploration

These notebooks also focus on data, but on derived/extrapolated/computed values.

- Viewing_AIS_Gaps.ipynb
- Viewing_Tracks.ipynb

### Prototypes

These files start with processed/prepared data, and approximate an end-user task (e.g. hit detection).

- Hit_Finder.ipynb
- Hit_Dashboard.ipynb

### Machine Learning Use cases

- DOD_anomaly.ipynb - Case study provided by H2O for Pinnacle Use Case: Classify Suspicious Activity from AIS Data
- PrepareDataForMachineLearning.ipynb - Curate and Prepare Data for various Pinnacle Use cases.

### Data preparation

These files start with raw data and create cleaned/consolidated/computed data for use in the other categories. Many of these use scripts in `scripts/`.

- AIS_Analyze_Vessel_Cluster.ipynb
- AIS_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb
- AIS_Parser.ipynb
- AIS_Validation.ipynb
- TLE_Compute_Timing.ipynb
- TLE_Parser.ipynb
- TLE_h5_build_index.ipynb
- TLE_lat_long_api.ipynb
- TLE_precompute_checks.ipynb
- TLE_to_pytables.ipynb



## Data

These notebooks and scripts expect files to be in a `data/` subdirectory of this directory, which by default is a symbolic link to /data. You can obtain the files from [vault-data-corpus on S3](http://vault-data-corpus.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/), and put them in /data on your own system (local or cloud) if you have access to /, or else put the data somewhere in your writable directories and update the ./data symlink to point to its location.
